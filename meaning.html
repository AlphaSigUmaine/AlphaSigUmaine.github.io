<p> <center>  <h1> The Five Points</h1> </center>
  <ul>
  <p>  <li>Silence</li>
      He has the strength to embrace silence and the will
      to build an interior life founded upon an honest desire
      to truly listen to others. Trust in silence transcends the
      gulf that is created when men feel the need to complete in action
      or rhetoric. He is introspective and self-reliant.

<p>    <li>Charity</li>
    He is charitable in the broadest sense of the world.
    A man who strives for a life of charity and service is
    more patient, kinder, and more forgiving of the flaws
    of others. A charitable man sacrifices of himself to
    help others and seeks no recognition in return. He
    is humble, reverent, and generous.
  <p>  <li>Purity</li>
    He consistently strives for purity of mind, body, and
    soul. The man who is pure of thought, word, and
    deed does not shrink from adversity or lofty goals.
    There is no self-pity, rationalizations, or apologies.
    He is moral and a gentleman in the finest sense of the word.

  <p>  <li>Honor</li>
    He lives a life of personal integrity, thereby accruing
    honor. An honorable man lives up to promises
    made-to others and to himself. A man of honor is
    not vain and is willing to endure scorn or ostracism
    rather than conform to the pressures of peers,
    superiors, or the fashion of the day. He is ethical,
    honest, and trustworthy.

  <p>  <li>Patriotism</li>
    He loves his country, remaining consistenty
    engaged in its affairs. He seeks to know his country
    and to pass that knowledge on to others. He is
    devoted to the principles of personal freedom,
    justice, and civic responsibility embedded in the
    U.S. Constitution that have made our country great.
    He is loyal, proud, and humble.
